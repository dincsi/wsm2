Website-manager-2 (wsm2) is a simple command-line toolkit to setup Apache-2 webserver in a relative safe manner with ModSecurity and AwStats on Debian then create and manage static and PHP websites.

Main features:
* public webservice via http and via reverse proxied https;
* simple certificate handling for per-virtualhost server and client certificates;
* enhanced ModSecurity support with OWASP core rule set updates;
* per-virtualhost configurable https certificates via server name indication;
* per-virtualhost authenticated developer access, files upload via https DAV;
* per-virtualhost authenticated developer access to Apache/PHP logs via https;
* per-virtualhost webcron facility;
* per-virtualhost authenticated access to daily updated AwStats web statistics via https;
* easy to use command line virtualhost creation, saving (incl. docroot, logs, stats) and removal;
* easy to use command line per-virtualhost Apache virtual users management (htpasswd, users, groups);
* periodic checking of all virtualhosts accessibility and error notification;
* humbly geolocation support;
* lot of tricks and minor enhancements :-).
wsm2 derived from Apache 1.3-compatible old wsm(1) and licensed under GNU/GPL v2+.

CHANGELOG
2017-03-26 v2.6.6 (NOT tested on Debian Squeeze, which is deprecated!)
mod: The modsec-update-owasp is now compatible with ModSecurity CRS 3.x ruleset.
     Patched for https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/651
     The wsm2 --configure call also modified. Affects Apache 2.4 only.
mod: A wget parameter (--tries=1) hardcoded into urlcheck to avoid ten repetitive
     webcron calls on error or on timeout.
mod: Improved canonical link headers, now isn't added to the canonical host hits.
     TODO: proper handling the http/https protocol mismatch which is simply
     ignored now. Affects Apache 2.4 only.
mod: Added the ServerLimit directive to MPM Prefork local settings consistently
     with the MaxRequestWorkers value, which was raised to 256 (the Apache 2.4
     default). Affects Apache 2.4 only.
fix: Added a LimitUIDRange directive to MPM Prefork local settings, which seems
     to be necessary in Apache 2.4 for email sending from PHP - see:
     http://blog.gaiterjones.com/send-php-mail-ubuntu-upgrade/
fix: A condition for request headers added before https->http proxy rewrite in 
     Apache 2.4 https configuration. The PHP logtail now works in https-enforced
     vhosts also.
fix: Added a size limit to stream_get_contents call in wsm2-logtail.php to avoid
     memory exhaustion when the log fills rapidly.
fix: Inclusion of Show* directives into /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.common file
     makes the missing statistic subpages now generated.
fix: Modified wsm2-webcron.sh does not send error messages in every minute if
     find an invalid symlink (e.g mcedit lockfile) in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
     directory.
fix: The wsm2 --configure call now does not overwrite the already existing
     99-wsm2-php5.ini configuration file.
fix: Deprecated (dead) see also links in robots.txt template were updated.

2016-05-03 v2.6.5
new: Ajax and JQuery-based https logtail PHP utility for developers with
     administrative (same as WebDAV) authentication. This feature enables
     real-time log watching instead of downloading them repeatedly.
     Requires installed PHP, of course. Experimental, handle with care!
new: Commented forensic log entries in http/https template.
new: Canonical header for SEO purposes (indicating same content accessible
     by multiple URLs). Experimental feature, isn't active by default and
     available only for Apache 2.4. Handle with care!
mod: Hiding PHP sources, if the module isn't installed or isn't enabled
     (within http configuration only - DAV isn't affected).
mod: During wsm2 --configure R/O access added for Debian's backup group (disk)
     to the web root folder. Thereafter Amanda may make backup the virtualhosts
     separately. Warning: comes into effect during a fresh install only! On
     upgrade execute 'setfacl -m g:disk:rx /var/www' manually (as root).
fix: Consistent http/php max_execution_time and https ProxyTimeout values.
fix: Consistent http/php post_max_size and http/php upload_max_filesize
     and https SSLRenegBufferSize values on area protected with client
     certificates (only for Apache 2.4).
fix: Error messages from awstats and modsecurity cron jobs if wsm2 installed,
     but not yet configured.

2015-06-16 v2.6.4
new: Logrotate job for /log/*/*.log files (expected application's logfiles,
     may symlinked from somewhere writable for www-data).
fix: The wsm2 -cw call now uses the correct http.conf.X template in Debian
     Squeeze and Wheezy.
fix: A typo in log entry about Apache vhost configuration creating.

2015-05-22 v2.6.3
new: A weekly cron job to refresh the SSL client certificate revoking lists
     for virtualhosts, generated previously by "wsm2 -cwca" call (if any).
mod: All BrowserMatch and some SetEnvIf directives were changed to SetEnvIfNoCase
     in http.conf for all versions.
fix: Invalid BrowserMatch/SetEnvIf string for Dreamweaver was fixed in http.conf
     for all versions.
fix: An unnecessary AllowOverrideList directive was removed from upload folder
     definition in http.conf (only for Apache 2.4).

2015-04-23 v2.6.2
new: Buggy browser section in http.conf for http also.
new: The redirect-carefully directive was added for Dreamweaver in http.conf.
mod: The nokeepalive directive was added optionally for all IE browsers in
     http.conf for http and https (Ajax problem: network error 0x2ef3).
new: Added SSLRenegBufferSize directive in Apache 2.4 http.conf only, for
     https client-authenticated section, to enable PHP upload of files larger
     than the 128K default value. This value must be equal to PHP upload limit
     and maximum POST size (10 MB by default, in wsm2).

2015-04-02 v2.6.1
new: Placeholders for application-specific rewrites and aliases in http.conf.*
     templates.
mod: The general-purpose rewrites now precede the virtualhost's directives in
     http.conf.* templates. This reflects the order of the processing better.
mod: The DreamWeaver now treated as buggy browser, which needs careful redirect
     in https DAV section of http.conf template (only for Apache 2.4).
fix: Removed colons before the port number from X-Forwarded-Port headers, added on
     automatic https -> http proxy calls, in http.conf.* templates.

2015-03-16 v2.6 - many changes, take care!
     This is a major upgrade, beacause in Debian Jessie, the Apache webserver 
     was upgraded to 2.4.x (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html).
     A number extension (.6 for Squeeze, .7 for Wheezy, .8 for Jessie) indicates
     the version-dependent configurations and template files. wsm2 --configure
     uses the appropriate automatically.
new: Client certificate authentication for an URI path or the whole website in
     Apache 2.4 (Debian Jessie) http.conf template. With prepared settings e.g.
     you may force to https the WordPress admin URI (/wp-admin) and limit access
     they for him, who installed the password-protected /client.p12 certificate
     into their browser. This makes strangers' access (e.g. dictionary attacks)
     difficult very much. Protecting the whole site may make the operation safer
     for intranet-style, old and by design vulnerable web services.
new: Commented alias directive in http.conf files to revert the /icons/ alias
     optionally. This alias is set by default in alias module configuration,
     and need to show icons in fancy directory index. You may reverting, only
     if your website needs an own /icons/ folder.
mod: Certificate handling becomes more sophisticated.
     You may specify an existing certificate as 3rd parameter of "wsm2 -cw" call.
     If this is a web certificate, the virtualhost will use it. If this is a CA
     certificate, that will be used to sign a newly created web certificate. If
     you omit this parameter, a simple, self-signed certificate will be created
     (changed default behavior).
     A new call, the "wsm2 -cwca" was introduced to order an own, local CA, that
     will be created and will be used to sign a newly created web certificate.
     The common client certificate created then only, if a CA was involved, not
     when an existing or self-signed web certificate was used.
     A new call, the "wsm2 --revoke" was introduced to revoke certificates
     signed by a local or global CA. The certificate revocation list (CRL) now
     really working 
     The "wsm2 --cert" call may be used to refresh the website certificate e.g
     on expiry. If a CA was involved, this call revokes the actual certificate.
     When a CA was involved, With (new) "wsm2 --client" call you may issue many
     client certificates, subjected to some email addresses, eligibles for the
     client certificate authentication. This call may be used to refresh a
     previously issued client certificate also.
     Technically, the certificates are using 2048 bits RSA keys, and are signed
     with SHA256 digest algorythm. A local CA itself, uses 4096 bits RSA keys.
     The self-signed certificates aren't CA certificates now.
mod: SSL enhancements. In Debian Jessie, our websites now are getting the grade A
     at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html (with a real certificate).
     In Debian Squeeze or Wheezy, the grade is A-, but https is now protected
     against https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566 (POODLE).
     Warning: because of using strong ciphers only, the IE6 and Java 6 SSL client
     support was dropped.
mod: Storage for updated ModSecurity CRS was moved to /etc/modsecurity in Jessie.
mod: The newly created workplace for ModSecurity named as /var/lib/modsecurity
     instead /var/lib/mod_security. No change if this workplace already exists.
mod: Geo IP Free updater tries to download the precompiled .DAT update. Only on
     failure will try the .CSV download and local compilation.
mod: The /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.common now contains only the non-default and/or
     vital AwStats parameters. The AwStats tooltips plugin now loaded by default.
     The /etc/awstats/awstas.conf.local file also included into every virtualhosts
     AwStats configuration, via /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.template.
mod: PHP changes: more restrictions in disabled_functions, the default time zone
     now is calculated, not hardwired in wsm2-php5.ini template (for Debian
     Jessie and above only).
mod: Deprecated PHP4 (IfModule) directives were removed from all http templates.
mod: XHTML 1.0 DTD was introduced in the default webpage (index.html) template,
     which is now passes HTML Tidy tests.
fix: The ModSecurity concurrent log serializer worker (modsec-auditgen.sh) now
     refuses starting, when another instance is already running with the same
     parameters.
fix: False alert about orphaned AwStats configuration on disabled (but existing)
     Apache virtualhosts was eliminated in awstats_scanhosts script, invoked
     from cron.daily.
fix: Unnecessary AwStats configuration for 12th month of the current year isn't
     created now by awstats_refreshpages script, at every 1st day of a month.
fix: Handling certificates, the http://ip-api.com/ was introduced as geolocation
     web service, instead of the disrupted http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm
fix: SED regexp in urlcheck_distlogs.sh now handles the localpart of URI checked
     (e.g www.myweb.com/test.html now logged in the www.myweb.com-urlcheck.log).

2014-02-15 v2.5.1
mod: https->http proxy requests are'nt logged into access.log. Originally from: 
     http://www.techstacks.com/howto/log-client-ip-and-xforwardedfor-ip-in-apache.html
mod: optional "forcing http->https" rewrite now checks the X-Forwarded-For header
     so isn't necessary to specify server's own (proxy) IP here.
mod: curl_exec also disabled in wsm2-php5.ini.
fix: appropriate regexp in awstats and log handler rewrites, and LocationMatch 
     within http/https template.

2013-09-12 v2.5
new: wsm2 -cw sets up a minimal, by-virtualhost local certificate authority (CA) 
     for server side website certificate and a password-protected, common client 
     certificate to protect special pages (e.g. administrative login forms against
     distributed dictionary attacks) at Apache core (not web application) level.
     This deprecates common server certificate usage and sets up Apache to apply
     the Server Name Indication by default.
     Note: client certification feature is experimental now - be careful!
new: wsm2 -ca, -cert and -sign commands to certificate handling.
new: Switch to ModSecurity OWASP Core Rule Set with totally rewritten updater.
     Old updater will be used for Squeeze(-), new for Wheezy(+) automatically.
new: Current wsm2 version number added to wsm2-created Apache configurations.
mod: The big wsm2 header file now separated to wsm2 (small, site-specific) and
     wsm2-common (big, common headers) files.
mod: Rewritten https->http proxy rewrite rules, X-Forwarded headers were added.
mod: Per-virtualhost subfolders in /etc/apache2/auth.d - old structure without
     subfolders remains compatible.
fix: ModSecurity common errata ruleset now considered also.
fix: Used "$@" instead of $* in website-manager-2.sh for command-line parameters.

2013-07-09 v2.4.1
new: A default virtualhost FQHN may be specified replacing previously used fully 
     qualified hostname of the server machine.
fix: DAV lock folder recreated at every reboot from wsm2 cronjob, according to
     FHS 3.0 introduced in Wheezy (/var/lock moved to /run and purged at reboot).

2013-04-04 v2.4
new: Debian Wheezy compatibility. A number extension (.6 for Squeeze, .7 for
     Wheezy) indicates maior version dependent template files. wsm2 --configure 
     uses appropriate automatically.
new: The http template now prepared for Server Name Indication (per-virtualhost
     https certificates). Predefined store of per-virtualhost certs is Apache
     authentication folder. Command wsm2 --saveweb saves these certs also.
mod: Dropped (not tested) Debian Lenny compatibility.
mod: Different php.ini overrides for Squeeze and Wheezy according to removal of 
     safe mode in PHP 5.4 that Wheezy contains.
mod: PHP date.timezone in php.ini override for Wheezy (avoiding UTC timed PHP log).
mod: ModSecurity auditlog relevance restricted to 5xx errors (4xx dropped from here).
mod: ModSecurity is now Off (not Detection Only) in https configuration preventing
     exhaustive audit log production.
mod: ModSecurity is now Off where PHP is explicite disabled in http.conf template.
fix: Commented SymLinksIfOwnerMatch options in http template according to
     changed ownership check as documented in Apache 2.2.17 changelog.

new: ModSecurity logging method changed to concurrent, mutex issue resolved.
     Per-virtualhost ModSecurity logs (*-modsec.log and *-audit.log).
     Audit log entries serialized by a cron job running in every 5 mins.
     Audit log events folder cleaned up once a day.
     Unusable wsm2-modsec-auditlogger removed from the package.
new: Platform autodetection in geoipfree-update script.
mod: PHP magic quotes are disabled by default.
mod: PHP error_reporting now excludes deprecated levels.
mod: Unusual HTTP methods via https aren't logged. ModSecurity running
     DetectionOnly on https and PROPDIND (DAV) generated lot of loglines.
fix: urlcheck-scanhosts isn't doubles URL calls.
fix: Forgotten geo-compute.sh /bin/bash sha-bang (for Squeeze) fixed.

fix: description of severe ModSecurity 2.5 bug fixing in INSTALL.howto.
new: /etc/apache2/modsecurity contains (linked or native) ModSecurity components.
new: ModSecurity 2.5 ruleset compatibility settings in wsm2-modsec template.
new: ModSecurity 2.5 ruleset (semi)automatic non-destructive weekly update.
